 📊 Sentiment and Topic Analysis of UNIQLO Social Media Data  

 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes sentiment and topics from **social media comments on UNIQLO Malaysia's Instagram page**. The goal is to derive insights into customer engagement, product preferences, and seasonal trends using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.  

 📂 Files in the Repository  
- **`CDS511-Project Sentiment.ipynb`** – Notebook containing sentiment analysis of user comments.  
- **`Topic Modelling.ipynb`** – Notebook implementing topic modeling to discover prevalent themes in discussions.  
- **`Text Analysis Social Media Uniqlo.pdf`** – Summary of findings, including key insights from sentiment analysis and topic modeling.  

 🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK, SpaCy, Gensim, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Machine Learning Techniques:** Sentiment Analysis, Topic Modeling (Latent Dirichlet Allocation - LDA)  
- **Data Source:** Instagram comments from UNIQLO Malaysia's official page  

 📊 Key Findings  
1. **Sentiment Trends:**  
   - Positive engagement peaks during **promotional campaigns** and **interactive contests**.
